# RESEARCH SYSTEMS

## To understand symbiotic phenomena broadly, we have selected two very different study systems for the following rationale:

<u>Marine bivalve-gammaproteobacterial chemosynthetic mutualisms</u>
  - Tractable experimental marine symbiosis
  - Accessible populations for next-gen short and long read sequencing
  - Results are broadly applicable across these ancient associations

<u>Fruit fly- Wolbachia manipulative symbioses</u>
  - Powerful model organism with established tools and protocols
  - Symbiont-host co-cell culture
  - High quality symbiont and host nuclear genomes available
  - Bacterial mechanisms for host manipulation can be applied to insect disease vector control
