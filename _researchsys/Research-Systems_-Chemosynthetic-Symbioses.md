## Marine Bivalve-bacteria Chemosynthetic Systems: Tractable Model System For Marine Nutritional Symbioses (E.g., Hydrothermal Vent Symbioses)

>“And the most extreme examples of this mutually assured success can be found in the deep oceans, where some microbes supplement their hosts to such a degree that the animals can eat the most impoverished diets of all – nothing.”
― Ed Yong, I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life

Using Illumina short read and Nanopore long read sequencing, 
we have characterized the transmission dynamics and population genomic diversity of marine bivalves 
and their chemosynthetic symbionts across the full range of transmission modes in order to assess the 
impact horizontal transmission and recombination have on symbiont genome evolution (see Publications). 
Future work will use the tractable S. velum system described below to understand the cellular and metabolic interactions that underpin this association.
